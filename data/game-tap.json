    "introduction": "Tap Champion is my clone of “Guitar Hero” mixed with “Osu!” and “Genshin Impact”s event-mini game. The project is designed and coded entirely by myself. I want to focus on usability and the backend side of it. In the future I plan to work on the general appearance and aesthetics (UI, Animations, Shaders). Since Tap Champion is still in development, this post will also be changing. I have built whole songs system or actually “.tapch” files, which is my way of storing and sharing song files. This file stores information about: the actual sound track, the only extension that my game supports is “.mp3” the background image of the song, the extensions “.png” or “.jpg” are opreated NoteFile, which has basic information and note maps divided into 3 difficulty levels The notes are devided into short and long ntoes, which are distinguished by the time the key is pressed.",
    "feature_number": 5,
    "feature_1_title": "Main menu",
    "feature_1": "A simple menu with a few key options, such as choosing whether the player wants to play, record, or import songs from a “.tapch” file. Songs to import should be in “Download” folder and then they while be placed in “Songs” folder.",
    "feature_2_title": "Recording",
    "feature_2": "This stage is intended for recording a song “from scratch” or for editing an existing one. It starts by loading a song using the “Import Song” button, where the player has to select an “.mp3” file to upload. The game automatically detects if the track already exist in the game's “Songs” folder. Based on the selected mp3 file name, the game tries to load other information. The player can then add notes by pressing the mapped keys to record the notes. Notes can be deleted, moved over timeline and moved to other tracks (keys). Changes will be saved after clicking the “Save track” button and completing the track information. I want to do as much of the work myself as possible, but I also want to use one of Unity's biggest features, the Asset Store, for this reason I used a simple file browser.",
    "feature_3_title": "Song Selection",
    "feature_3": "The stage where the saved songs are loaded, from which the player can select the ones he wants to play.\n I programmed the option to create a queue, or playlist instead of plating just one.\n Clicking of song results in playing short demo of it.",
    "feature_4_title": "Game",
    "feature_4": "The player can play a previously selected song. I tried to mimic Genishin's approach of design. However I prefer Guitar Hero's gameplay, so I did my best to apply that one. As the player hits the notes, the multiplier increases rewarding the player with more points. The multiplier resets when the player fails to hit a note or when he presses a button even though there is no note on it. At the end player's scores is updated and saved to played song.",
    "feature_5_title": "Settings",
    "feature_5": "Multi level overlay, where player can:\n -change key binds\n -select the difficulty\n -change the lag offset\n"
